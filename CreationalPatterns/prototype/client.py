# Specify the kind of objects to create using a protypical instance
#Creating new object by copying the prototype. 

# Use a Prototype pattern when a system should be independent of how its products are
# created, composed, and represented. 

# Use a prototype pattern when classes to be instantiated are specified at runtime. 
# Avoiding the creation of a factory hierarchy is needed. 
# It is more convenient to copy an existing instance than to create a new one. 


#Example: Repearted elements in a game (rooms, doors, object ...)
